### 🎨 File Format

**Preferred: PNG with transparency**
- Allows logos to work on any background color
- Best for logos with sharp edges and text

**Also Acceptable: SVG**
- Vector format scales perfectly
- Smaller file sizes for simple logos

**Not Recommended:**
- ❌ JPG/JPEG (no transparency support)
- ❌ GIF (limited color palette)
- ❌ WebP (broad support but PNG is more universal)

### 🖼️ Background

**MUST be transparent**
- The website displays logos on various backgrounds
- White backgrounds won't work on white sections
- Transparent backgrounds ensure consistent appearance

### 📁 File Naming

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- ✅ `city-of-hollister.png`
- ✅ `gavilan-college.png`
- ❌ `City of Hollister.png`
- ❌ `gavilan_college.PNG`

### 💾 File Size

- Maximum: **500KB** per logo
- Optimize images before uploading
- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

## How to Check Your Logo

1. **Transparent background test**: Open in an image viewer and ensure you see a checkered pattern behind the logo (not white)

2. **Size check**: Right-click the file → Properties/Get Info to verify dimensions are at least 400px wide

3. **File size check**: Should be under 500KB

## Need Help?

If you have a logo but it doesn't meet these requirements:

1. **Wrong format?** Use free tools like:
   - Remove.bg (remove background)
   - Photopea.com (free Photoshop alternative)
   - CloudConvert.com (format conversion)

2. **Too small?** Request a higher resolution version from the sponsor

3. **Has background?** Use Remove.bg or ask for the original with transparency
