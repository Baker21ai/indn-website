        - paragraph [ref=e58]: In 2023, when the San Juan Bautista Indian Market closed, something precious was lost. Not just an event, but a gathering place. A home for Indigenous youth in San Benito County to see themselves reflected, to connect with their heritage, to simply belong.
        - paragraph [ref=e59]: We didn't wait for someone else to fill that void. Our community came together. Elders who carried knowledge, families who carried hope, and youth who carried tomorrow's dreams created something new.
        - paragraph [ref=e61]: “We are the only organization providing year-round Indigenous cultural programming in San Benito County. But we're not here to replace what was lost. We're here to build what's needed.”
        - paragraph [ref=e62]: From 500 to 1,000+ participants in three years. From one annual event to monthly gatherings, youth-led programs, gardens growing food for families, and AI workshops preparing our youth for futures we can barely imagine.
        - paragraph [ref=e63]: This is what happens when a community refuses to let its youth fall through the cracks.
