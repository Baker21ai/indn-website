        - paragraph [ref=e95]: We didn't wait for someone else to fill that void. Our community came together. Elders who carried knowledge, families who carried hope, and youth who carried tomorrow's dreams created something new.
        - paragraph [ref=e97]: “We are the only organization providing year-round Indigenous cultural programming in San Benito County. But we're not here to replace what was lost. We're here to build what's needed.”
        - paragraph [ref=e98]: From 500 to 1,000+ participants in three years. From one annual event to monthly gatherings, youth-led programs, gardens growing food for families, and AI workshops preparing our youth for futures we can barely imagine.
