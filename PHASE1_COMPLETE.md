## Next Steps - Phase 2

## Technical Notes

**Security:**

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost: 12)
- Email uniqueness enforced at DB and API level
- Cascade deletes handle related records

**Database:**
- Uses existing Prisma schema
- Volunteer profile auto-created for volunteers
- Role changes handled gracefully

**UI Patterns:**
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for forms/interactivity
- shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Terracotta color scheme maintained

**Status**: ✅ **READY TO USE**

All user management features are implemented and working!
